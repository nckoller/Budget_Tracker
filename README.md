## Description

This is a progressive web application that allows users to add deposits and withdrawals from a budget tracker while both online and offline. When the user is offline, the pending transactions are stored until the user is brought back online. Using the Developer Tools, you can simulate the user being offline and see that the pending transactions are stored in an IndexedDB that will be added to MongoDB Atlas once back online.
